    "overview": "Little Italy is charming!  It is a very cute, friendly neighborhood with so much to do within walking distance.  Just steps away are numerous restaurants (mostly Italian, of course!), bars and shops.  I love them all and  would recommend the following: Isola and NaPizza (pizza); Bencotto (pasta); Kettner Exchange, Juniper & Ivy, and Prepkitchen (American); Ironsides (seafood); El Camino (Mexican/brunch); Burger Lounge (burgers); Pappalecco (coffee/gelato); Davanti (wine); Craft & Commerce (cocktails); Waterfront (dive bar); Bottlecraft (beer).   Little Italy provides you all the conveniences of downtown life (no car needed, but close proximity to highways if driving), but is also removed enough that you can enjoy peace and quiet.  Must do's within walking distance (or if preferred, trolley or cab): the famous Gaslamp Quarter, San Diego Harbor, Seaport Village, Petco Park (Padres baseball), Coronado Island (via ferry), Balboa Park, USS Midway Museum and more!  The San Diego Zoo and Sea",

    "description": "Our bright and spacious one bedroom apartment is in a restored deco triplex from 1939. Located between downtown and Korea-Town and just south of Silver Lake and Echo Park, we are close to key public transportation as well as the major freeways connecting you to the rest of the city. Our Los Angeles home is a restored 1930's spacious one bedroom apartment in a tri-plex I own with my two brothers.  The bedroom has a California King bed, touch-adjust lighting and ceiling fan, walk in closet, and side table with docking stereo for your iPhone. There is a window air conditioning unit in this room for when it gets to hot for comfort. Also, we have a Pack'n'Play for those with small children. The bathroom is newly renovated and is light and airy with a full tub and shower for tall people. The living room is spacious with design furniture and windows looking out on the tree-tops and the mountains behind. There is a flat screen tv (local stations only) with DVD player, stereo and wireless inter",
    "overview": "Our neighborhood is at the southeast corner of  Korea-Town, south of Echo Park and Silverlake and just west of Downtown. The first suburb of downtown Los Angeles, there are many historic buildings and architectural treasures. MacArthur Park is a 5 minute walk down from our hill with a small lake to walk around, soccer field, playgrounds and an amphitheater with summer concert series. There are a lot of Central American families living here and some great little restaurants... but the gem in Los Angeles' restaurant crown is Langer's Deli which was voted best Deli in America some time back - order sandwich #19!! Note* This is one of the few neighborhoods next to downtown that hasn't been gentrified yet. We think this is a good thing but feel it's important to point it out so as to manage expectations. If you are looking for hipster coffee and cupcake shops this isn't the Airbnb for you. If you want a real slice of LA life, Bienvenido:)",
    "rules": "This is our family home and we only ask that you take care of it as you would of your own. My brothers also live in the building so please be kind, courteous and quiet. There are two separate entrances; the stairwell at the front houses our father's paintings and though they may not be worth much in the art world, they are priceless to us. If you use this entrance you must always be certain it is locked, even when you are home. The second entrance is the back stairwell through the side gate where the parking is, we would appreciate if you used this entrance as it is the safest, quietest and most private of the two. (please be sure to open and shut this gate quietly as it can make a good deal of noise. Thanks)",

Among the new condos that are gleaming like sequins in this longtime hub of the wholesale garment industry is 212 Fifth Avenue, a 48-unit condo conversion at West 26th Street from a team led by the developer Madison Equities. Like many NoMad edifices, No. 212 has a vaguely medieval style—indeed, the views from some of its apartments are of a façade adorned with sword-clasping knights. But NoMad is coming out of the Dark Ages and into the light. “This was a commercial area, and that kind of worked against it for a while,” says Efraim Tessler, an associate broker with Keller Williams New York City. “But New Yorkers are always looking for a hidden gem.” In another telltale sign, rentals are going condo, like at 88 and 90 Lexington Avenue,",

    "overview": "Harlem is known internationally as the Mecca of the African diaspora, but Harlem has been home to many different identities including the Dutch, Irish, German, Italian, and Jewish. Harlem was originally settled by the Dutch in 1658, but was largely farmland and undeveloped territory for approximately 200 years. As New York’s population grew, residential and commercial expansion moved northward, and development of the Harlem territory was inevitable. During the 1880’s, elevated rail lines were extended north along Eight & Ninth Avenues, encouraging expansion northward. Development of transportation lines caused speculation on the land and many fine row houses and multiple family apartment buildings were erected. However, this boom slowed in 1893 when a national recession struck. The recession curbed further developed and stymied real estate sales. When the economy recovered in 1895, development continued, especially in the form of beautiful apartment buildings. Located on 123rd street,",

You won't receive a response. Instead, keep all communication on Airbnb. I have a service that looks after my home, and they can respond to you promptly via Airbnb 24/7.

You will have a key to the apartment-please don't lose it, if you do, there is a 75 lost key fine which is payable to me, in cash.  I've had too many of my guests lose keys and it costs me 75 to have the doors re-keyed. 3.  Be respectful 4.  Clean up after yourself 5.  Be nice to my cat 6.  Have a sense of humor-I love to laugh! Smoking is fine. (Cigarettes)-but due to complex rules, which I personally find ridiculous & I'm not a smoker, you have to smoke off-site.  All you have to do is stand on the sidewalk, which is maybe 50 feet from the apartment.  If you aren't from California you will find that a majority of places, including bars and restaurants are smoke free in California.  As for alcohol that's fine-San Diego is known for its craft beer.  I'm not much of a drinker, but I'm a great designated driver.",

Great restaurants, nightlife, and Brooklyn landmarks within walking distance. If my apartment were a meal, it'd be comfort food. I hope the apartment provides you with things that New York city does not make readily available: quiet, comfort, space, and coziness. Queen foam mattress is very comfortable. It's a liability if you're trying to fit in as much as you can while here. Duvet insert is down alternative. Extra blankets available. The apartment is on the fourth floor of a walk-up building. No elevator. No need for a gym. TV: Apple TV and DVD player are yours. Netflix, HBO, Showtime, ESPN, and more apps are up and running. No cable, but bunny ear antennae pick up the networks in case you want to indulge in football, Jeopardy, etc. Books: Many good books. Kitchen: Coffee, tea, and popcorn for your consumption. French press, tea pot, milk froth",

Airbnb does not allow me to provide links, but you can (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) articles about the neighborhood from the Times or the Post that give a more accurate and updated view of the neighborhood. You can also look up some of the local attractions like Prospect Park, Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, Brooklyn Museum, Grand Army Plaza, Berg'n, Chavela's, Barboncino, etc. The guests who have stayed with me love the neighborhood. No one visits NYC to hang out in the apartment. Subways: A, C, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are all accessible within 5 minute walk. 20 minute ride to downtown; 40 minutes to midtown. Easy to hail cab or Uber/call car service from door. Bus lines abound. You can also stay in the neighborhood",

Experience the fusion of hipster, Caribbean and Hasidic cultures and wander around brownstone Brooklyn; explore Prospect park, Franklin Avenue bars and restaurants, and local underground culture. Ever watched the sun rise over the rooftops of Brooklyn, peeking through the trees to herald in a brand new busy day? I love my large, sun-filled living room for the incredible views, and can't wait to share it with you.  Enjoy your private bedroom with a full size bed, closet, drawers and comfy corner couch, perfect for relaxing on after a long day in New York City. My vegetarian/kosher kitchen is great for cooking meals, making tea or coffee, or grabbing a quick breakfast before hitting the city! We share the space, but your own bedroom is private and features a small corner space for living and hanging out. You're welcome to share the living room",
    "overview": "Crown Heights was once known for racial tension, but now a sign of racial integration, as the area fuses its Afro-Carribbean and Hasidic heritage with newcomers thanks to gentrification and plenty of new cafes, bars and restaurants. Waltz down Nostrand Avenue for the best Trinidadian and Jamaican food from authentic hole-in-wall restaurants, or head a few blocks towards the Jewish enclave on Kingston Avenue for New York Jewish pastrami, bagels and the best people watching you'll ever see. Then there's the newfound hipster enclave of Franklin Ave (we have a Starbucks now..), and even a couple cafes nearby on Rogers and Bedford. Get your ultimate #Brooklyn Insta shots by strolling or resting on a bench on nearby Eastern Parkway for people watching and the best New York slice of nature in the middle of a busy parkway. Best of all, Prospect Park is only a 25 minute walk away, and yes, it is better than Central Park and I will tell you why.",
