Walking distance to two great neighborhood retail streets.  400 square feet / 26 square meters. A guest suite in the finished attic of our single family home, it is often reserved for our friends and visiting family.

The space is simple and cozy, with a pitched ceiling that may not be comfortable for taller people.  The bed is queen-sized, with a locally made McCroskey mattress. In the living room, there is also a pull-out couch. The couch can fit two people who like each other very much, and is reasonably comfortable for a pull-out couch.

Our house sits in a saddle on the ridge between two valleys, Noe Valley and Eureka Valley, sheltered from the fog by Twin Peaks, which lies immediately to our west.  Noe Valley is historically a working class, Irish and Italian neighborhood, built mainly in the (PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN)s, with its commercial center along 24th St. Today, it is increasingly becoming commuter suburb of Silicon Valley investors and programmers, including (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)'s Mark Zuckerberg, who lives in a much fancier house along our same ridge. Noe exemplifies the tensions between Old and New San Francisco, with shops unchanged since the early 20th century, adjacent to purveyors of the latest trends. Seeing few tourists, it's a great place to explore the complexities of historic and modern SF. Eureka Valley's heart is the Castro. The same qualities that made the Castro the Center of the Gay Universe in the (PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN)s -- its",

Please contact us by phone or email after you have made your reservation so that we can confirm what time you will be arriving.  The doorbell to the house is turned down so it is important that you call us by phone when you arrive. At that time we will give you two keys to the house, one for the outer door and one for the actual studio apartment.  We ask you to please not place any clothing items, towels, or anything on top of the heater.  Also please turn the heater off when you leave the studio.  Help us to conserve energy.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call. Seb and I are both happy to help you with restaurant tips, parking hints, and anything else that can help you have a relaxing stay with us. We hope you have a memorable stay in our beautiful neighborhood.",

Part of the structure of the main house was originally built near Mission Dolores (now Dolores Park) as temporary housing in 1906 after The Great Earthquake.  Along with a small handful of remaining homes scattered around San Francisco, it was moved, by horse and carriage, to Eureka St around 1910, when it was purchased for 50.  It was sold again in 1926 to David Raff and his wife Rosa, both German immigrants.  David and Rosa had four children, including three sons, who as teenagers built a 2 story "club house" in the backyard.  The Raff boys\' clubhouse has since been renovated, as has the main house, but we still affectionately refer to it as the Raff Cottage. Our Raff Cottage is conveniently located directly on the border of Noe Valley and the Castro (one of the most desirable neighborhoods in the city), a short walk to restaurants and shops on 24th St in Noe Valley, as well as the heart of the Castro and Mission districts.

            "This peaceful one-bedroom is the upper unit of a 1920s duplex—views of Twin Peaks and downtown!—near the Mission and Noe Valley. Deck and backyard too, with Cortland Ave, Bernal Hill, and Muni just 5 minutes walk away. About a thousand square feet, the flat is perfect for one or two people. In addition to the bedroom, there is a home office—not shown in the photos—where a third person can sleep, by prior arrangement, but French doors connect that room to the living room, so it's not as private as a real bedroom. Guests can use the entire apartment, except for one locked hall closet. The fireplace, unfortunately, is not usable at present. The deck outside the kitchen belongs to this apartment; the backyard is shared with the downstairs unit. (There is a gas grill in the backyard that guests are welcome to use.) Coin-operated washer and dryer are in the garage. This apartment is only available while we're out of town, though we'll leave detailed instructions for all appliances, and conta",

This apartment is on the western slope of the hill, just a couple blocks up from Mission Street (with many good restaurants and cafes and bars), but because Heyman doesn't go all the way to Mission, it's insulated from any noise and traffic. Cortland Avenue, with its cute shops and restaurants, is a five-minute walk south.",
