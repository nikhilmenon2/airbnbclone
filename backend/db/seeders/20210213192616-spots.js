The nightlife is just as varied as the daytime, with hookah spots, salsa dancing, beer gardens, and more. Astoria is very much a little community where it’s almost impossible to find a big box store nearby. A historical immigrant neighborhood, what started with Irish and Italian has morphed into a large Greek and North African community.
